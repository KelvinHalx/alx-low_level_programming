### DOG HEADER

### Mandatory

### [1-init_dog.c](https://github.com/Valentinaga1/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/1-init_dog.c   "1-init_dog.c")
Function that initialize a variable of type struct dog.  
Prototype: void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner);

### [2-print_dog.c](https://github.com/Valentinaga1/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0E-structures_typedef/2-print_dog.c   "2-print_dog.c")
Function that prints a struct dog.  
Prototype: void print_dog(struct dog *d);  
Format: see example bellow.  
You are allowed to use the standard library.
